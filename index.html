						  <p>Food has always been something that brings people together. Each culture has their own unique way of cooking and baking which creates a vairety of diffent flavors and recipies. Recipies are passed down from generation to generation and are a way of keeping people and memories alive. Sometimes just the smell or the taste of an old food can flood someone with nostalgia.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
							<p>A great way to immerse youself into a culture is to attend a local cooking class. Many students who study abroad in Italy participate in pasta making classes as part of their cultural experiences. By participating in these classes you are pafticipating in the community and showing that you care about their customs and ways of life.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
							  <p>There are many religious traditions and customs that involve food as well. During holiday times and special occasions there are often distinct foods and desserts that people of certain religions will make. Food is a very important part of these holidays and is often around a dinnner that peope come to gather.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
